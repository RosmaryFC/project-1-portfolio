## Project Description

Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality.

Introducing, Our Unit-1 project for General Assembly's SEI program.
For Project 1, I will be creating a personal website that displays work I have done so far throughout the program. This project will include a 
* home page - which has a little about me, my goals, and my hobbies?
* projects/resume page - holds a pdf version of my resume, also displays a list of projects I've worked on.
* Each page will have a footer - that links to my github, LinkedIn, and a little box where you can contact me?

* I'll be using the color combination Rosy Dew, found on [Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palettes/rosy-dew/).
  * Check out their color palettes [here](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palettes/)!
  * If there is a color palette you'd like to make based on a color you'd like, Canva recommends using this [color wheel](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/).
  * More info on website color schemese [here](https://www.canva.com/learn/website-color-schemes/).

Some inspiration for animations has come from [pursuit](https://www.pursuit.org/fellowship). I also really like their web design.
A lot of inspiration came from exercises we've worked on in class.

## Wireframes

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP (examples)

- Header section - has navigation bar, a picture of myself, a background image, my name and title
- About Me  section - has a small about me blurp
- Projects section - lists prjects in a grid format. On hover, it shows a small blurp of the project
- Contact Me section - has links to github, email, and linked in. has text box where user can type in and send an email
- Responsive Layout Tablet - make website responsive for devices under 900px
- Responsive layout Mobile - make website responsive to devices under 350px

#### PostMVP 

- Animations
  * Animations for Nav Bar 
  * Animations for projects appearing

## Functional Components

I've broken down each part of the website to smaller tasks below.
