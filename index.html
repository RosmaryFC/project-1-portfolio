        <h2 class="sub-header">A LITTLE ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>My venture towards becoming a software developer is taking a new route in web development! As of October 2020, I have completed a Bootcamp for web development through LaGuardia Community College’s Tech Hire Open Code program in partnership with General Assembly.</p>

        <p>Prior to obtaining my technology background, I worked on the retail side of technology. I started off at Best Buy as a sales associate in a high volume store where I self-taught myself enough about computers that I later moved up to work at Geek Squad as a consultation agent where I would troubleshoot and repair devices. Throughout these positions, I gained strong interpersonal and communication skills, while also thriving in a fast-paced, collaborative environment. I then worked at T-mobile as a Sales Associate, where I provided customers with a complete mobile solution by engaging and asking questions while also meeting target goals. My biggest drive throughout my retail career has been to always be learning something new and finding solutions to improve the customer/employee experience.</p>

        <p>My programming journey started in 2016, when I attended a bootcamp where I was equipped with Android fundamentals. During this time I had the opportunity to make multiple android related solutions that could reach people all over the world. I really enjoyed the creativity and problem solving aspect of programming, and started incorporating it into places I felt could benefit from it such as my martial arts school. I volunteered at Hiraldo’s Kai where I assisted with any technical related issues while working on several projects such as re-creating the karate school logo, and creating promotional flyers and video’s for programs and events. This resulted in an increase in customer engagement. I worked on these design related projects to improve my design skills so that I could build a nicer Android app for the karate school.</p>

        <p>In January 2019, I interned at a company called RubiconMD where my team and I used an API called “Amazon Rekognition” (AR). This tool, that uses machine learning, allowed us to analyze images to see if it contained Personal Identifiable Information (PII). During the internship, my team and I learned Python to create the scripts that would analyze the information given to us from AR. I worked on determining if an image contained PII or not. Through collaborating and constant communication, we were able to analyze up to 32,000 images. </p>

        <p>In May 2020, I attended a Software Engineering bootcamp through General Assembly where I put over 400 hours in learning Full-Stack development, such as how to create a backend using different stacks like MEAN stack, Django stack, and Ruby on rails, and creating a frontend by using libraries such as Jquery, Bootstrap, and Beufy, as well as frameworks such as Vue and Bulma.</p>

        <p>I have also built three distinct fullstack applications: 1) Hiraldo’s Kai management, which gives the karate school a dashboard that helps manage its students, their progress, and their payments. 2) DevToob, an app where developers can look up programming videos, upvote or downvote them, and leave comments to have productive conversations regarding the video. 3) Hiraldo’s Kai event tracker, which displays the latest events, and allows its students to update whether they have attended the event or not!</p>
